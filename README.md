# brewController
BeagleBone Black C++ application for controlling a brew tun

It will control a 1,8 kW electric heating element. Monitor wort temperature.

Together with brewWeb, the client part, you can set recipes and monitor the progress of your brew in nice graphical presentations, althoug the design has not been my main issue.
